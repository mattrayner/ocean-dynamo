== ocean-dynamo

OceanDynamo is a massively scalable Amazon DynamoDB near drop-in replacement for 
ActiveRecord.

OceanDynamo requires Ruby 2.0 and Ruby on Rails 4.0.0 or later. Rails 5.0.x is supported,
but 5.1 will require a couple of changes.

=== Features

As one important use case for OceanDynamo is to facilitate the conversion of SQL
databases to no-SQL DynamoDB databases, it is important that the syntax and semantics
of OceanDynamo are as close as possible to those of ActiveRecord. This includes
callbacks, exceptions and method chaining semantics. OceanDynamo follows this pattern 
closely and is of course based on ActiveModel.

The attribute and persistence layer of OceanDynamo is modeled on that of ActiveRecord:
there's +save+, +save!+, +create+, +update+, +update!+, +update_attributes+, +find_each+,
+destroy_all+, +delete_all+, +read_attribute+, +write_attribute+ and all the other 
methods you're used to. The design goal is always to implement as much of the ActiveRecord
interface as possible, without compromising scalability. This makes the task of switching 
from SQL to no-SQL much easier.

OceanDynamo uses only primary indices to retrieve related table items and collections, 
which means it will scale without limits.

OceanDynamo is fully usable as an ActiveModel and can be used by Rails
controllers. Thanks to its structural similarity to ActiveRecord, OceanDynamo works 
with FactoryGirl.

OceanDynamo supports optimistic record locking via a combination of DynamoDB conditional 
writes and atomic updates. This is activated by default.

=== Current State

* Secondary indices are now fully supported! See below for more information.
* Version 2 of the AWS Ruby SDK is now used.
* Work begun on association proxies, etc.


=== Future milestones

* Direct support for the DynamoDB JSON attribute types for arrays and hashes
* Collection proxies, to implement ActiveRecord-style method chaining, e.g.: 
  <code>blog_entry.comments.build(body: "Cool!").save!</code>
* The +has_and_belongs_to_many+ assocation. 


=== Current use

OceanDynamo is used as a central component in Ocean, a Rails framework and development,
testing, and production pipeline for creating massively scalable HATEOAS microservice 
SOAs in the cloud.

However, OceanDynamo can of course also be used stand-alone.

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Fork in the usual way. OceanDynamo is developed using
TDD: the specs are extensive and test coverage is very near to 100 percent. Pull requests
will not be considered unless all tests pass and coverage is equally high or higher.
All contributed code must therefore also be exhaustively tested.


== Examples

=== Basic syntax

The following example shows the basic syntax for declaring a DynamoDB-based schema. 

  class AsyncJob < OceanDynamo::Table

    dynamo_schema(:guid) do
      attribute :credentials,          :string
      attribute :token,                :string,     default: Proc { SecureRandom.uuid }
      attribute :steps,                :serialized, default: []
      attribute :max_seconds_in_queue, :integer,    default: 1.day
      attribute :default_poison_limit, :integer,    default: 5
      attribute :default_step_time,    :integer,    default: 30
      attribute :started_at,           :datetime
      attribute :last_completed_step,  :integer
      attribute :finished_at,          :datetime
      attribute :destroy_at,           :datetime,   local_secondary_index: true
      attribute :created_by
      attribute :updated_by
      attribute :succeeded,            :boolean,    default: false
      attribute :failed,               :boolean,    default: false
      attribute :poison,               :boolean,    default: false
      
      global_secondary_index :token, projection: :all
    end
    
  end

=== Attributes

Each attribute has a name, a type (+:string+, +:integer+, +:float+, +:datetime+, +:boolean+, 
or +:serialized+) where +:string+ is the default. Each attribute also optionally has a default 
value, which can be a Proc. The hash key attribute is by default +:id+ (overridden as +:guid+ in
the example above) and is a +:string+.

The +:string+, +:integer+, +:float+ and +:datetime+ types can also store sets of their type.
Sets are represented as arrays, may not contain duplicates and may not be empty.

All attributes except the +:string+ type can take the value +nil+. Storing +nil+ for a string
value will return the empty string, <tt>""</tt>.

=== Schema args and options

+dynamo_schema+ takes args and many options. Here's the full syntax:

 dynamo_schema(
   table_hash_key = :id,                   # The name of the hash key attribute
   table_range_key = nil,                  # The name of the range key attribute (or nil)
   table_name: compute_table_name,         # The basename of the DynamoDB table
   table_name_prefix: nil,                 # A basename prefix string or nil
   table_name_suffix: nil,                 # A basename suffix string or nil
   read_capacity_units: 10,                # Used only when creating a table
   write_capacity_units: 5,                # Used only when creating a table
   connect: :late,                         # true, :late, nil/false
   create: false,                          # If true, create the table if nonexistent
   locking: :lock_version,                 # The name of the lock attribute or nil/false
   timestamps: [:created_at, :updated_at]  # A two-element array of timestamp columns, or nil/false
 ) do
   # Attribute definitions
   ...
   ...
 end
 
Tip: you might want to use the following idiom when declaring a +dynamo_schema+. It is used everywhere in Ocean:
 
 dynamo_schema(:id, table_name_suffix: Api.basename_suffix, 
                    create: Rails.env != "production") do
   ...
 end
 
This will auto-create the DynamoDB table in all environments except production, and it will also add a suffix to the table name in order to prevent tests from colliding. Cf +Api.basename_suffix+ in the +ocean-rails+ gem for more information.

== +has_many+ and +belongs_to+

=== Example

The following example shows how to set up +has_many+ / +belongs_to+ relations:
 
 class Forum < OceanDynamo::Table
   dynamo_schema do
     attribute :name
     attribute :description
   end
   has_many :topics, dependent: :destroy
 end
 
 
 class Topic < OceanDynamo::Table
   dynamo_schema(:guid) do
     attribute :title
   end
   belongs_to :forum
   has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
 end
 

 class Post < OceanDynamo::Table
   dynamo_schema(:guid) do
     attribute :body
   end
   belongs_to :topic, composite_key: true
 end

The only non-standard aspect of the above is <tt>composite_key: true</tt>, which 
is required as the Topic class itself has a +belongs_to+ relation and thus has
a composite key. This must be declared in the child class as it needs to know
how to retrieve its parent.


=== Restrictions

Restrictions for +belongs_to+ tables: 
* The hash key must be specified and must not be +:id+. 
* The range key must not be specified at all.
* +belongs_to+ can be specified only once in each class.
* +belongs_to+ must be placed after the +dynamo_schema+ attribute block.

Restrictions for +has_many+ tables:
* +has_many+ must be placed after the +dynamo_schema+ attribute block.

These restrictions allow OceanDynamo to implement the +has_many+ / +belongs_to+ 
relation in a very efficient and massively scalable way. 


=== Implementation

+belongs_to+ claims the range key and uses it to store its own id, which normally
would be stored in the hash key attribute. Instead, the hash key attribute holds the
id of the parent. We have thus reversed the roles of these two fields. As a result, 
all children store their parent id in the hash key, and their own id in the 
range key.

This type of relation is even more efficient than its ActiveRecord counterpart as
it uses only primary indices in both directions of the +has_many+ / +belongs_to+ 
association. No scans.

Furthermore, since DynamoDB has powerful primary index searches involving substrings
and matching, the fact that the range key is a string can be used to implement
wildcard matching of additional attributes. This gives, amongst other things, the 
equivalent of an SQL GROUP BY request, again without requiring any secondary indices.

It's our goal to use a similar technique to implement +has_and_belongs_to_many+ relations, 
which means that secondary indices won't be necessary for the vast majority of 
DynamoDB tables. This ultimately means reduced operational costs, as well as
reduced complexity.


== Secondary Indices

=== Local Secondary Indices

Up to five attributes can be declared as local secondary indices, in the following manner:

  class Authentication < OceanDynamo::Table
    dynamo_schema(:username, :expires_at) do
      attribute :token,       :string,   local_secondary_index: true
      attribute :max_age,     :integer
      attribute :created_at,  :datetime
      attribute :expires_at,  :datetime
      attribute :api_user_id, :string
    end
  end

The items of the above table can be accessed by using the hash key +:username+ and
the range key +:expires_at+. The +local_secondary_index+ declaration makes it possible
to access items using the same hash key +:username+ but with +:token+ as an alternate
range key. Local secondary indices all use the same hash key as the primary index,
substituting another attribute instead as the range key.

NB: The primary index <tt>[:username, :expires_at]</tt> requires all items to have a unique
combination of keys. Secondary indices don't require the range key to be unique for
the same hash key. This means that secondary index searches always will return a
collection.

Local secondary indices are queried through +find_local_each+ and +find_local+. 
They take the same arguments; the former yields to a block for each item, 
the other returns all items in an array.

The following finds all Authentications where +:username+ is "joe" and +:token+ is "quux":

 Authentication.find_local(:username, "joe", :token, "=", "quux")

This retrieves all Authentications belonging to Joe, sorted on +:token+:

 Authentication.find_local(:username, "joe", :token, ">=", "0")

The same thing but with the only the item with the highest token value:

 Authentication.find_local(:username, "joe", :token, ">=", "0",
                           scan_index_forward: false, limit: 1)


=== Global Secondary Indices

Global secondary indices are declared after all attributes, but still within the +do+
block:

  class Authentication < OceanDynamo::Table
    dynamo_schema(:username, :expires_at) do
      attribute :token,       :string,   local_secondary_index: true
      attribute :max_age,     :integer
      attribute :created_at,  :datetime
      attribute :expires_at,  :datetime
      attribute :api_user_id, :string

      global_secondary_index :token, projection: :all
      global_secondary_index :api_user_id, :expires_at, read_capacity_units: 100
      global_secondary_index :expires_at, write_capacity_units: 50
    end
  end

Each +global_secondary_index+ clause (there can be a maximum of 5 per table) takes 
the following arguments:
* +hash_value+ (required), 
* +range_value+ (optional), 
* +:projection+ (default +:keys_only+, +:all+ for all attributes)
* +:read_capacity_units+ (defaults to the table's read capacity, normally 10)
* +:write_capacity_units+ (default to the table's write capacity, normally 5)

Global secondary indices are queried through +find_global_each+ and +find_global+. 
They take the same arguments; the former yields to a block for each item, 
the other returns all items in an array.

The following finds all Authentications whose +:token+ is +"quux"+:

 Authentication.find_global(:token, "quux")

This retrieves all Authentications belonging to the user with the ID +"dfstw-ruyhdf-ewijf"+, 
sorted in ascending order of the +:expires_at+ attribute:

 Authentication.find_global(:api_user_id, "dfstw-ruyhdf-ewijf", 
                            :expires_at, ">=", 0)

To get the highest +:expires_at+ record:

 Authentication.find_global(:api_user_id, "dfstw-ruyhdf-ewijf", 
                            :expires_at, ">=", 0,
                            scan_index_forward: false, limit: 1)


== Installation

 gem install ocean-dynamo

Then, locate the gem's directory and copy 

 spec/dummy/config/initializers/aws.rb

to your project's

 config/initializers/aws.rb

Also copy 

 spec/dummy/config/aws.yml.example

to both the following locations in your project:

 config/aws.yml.example
 config/aws.yml

Enter your AWS credentials in the latter file.


== Running the specs

To run the specs for the OceanDynamo gem, you must first install DynamoDB Local. 
It's a Java clone of Amazon DynamoDB which runs locally on your computer. We use 
it for development and testing.

Download DynamoDB Local from the following location: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.DynamoDBLocal.html

Next, copy the AWS configuration file from the template:

 cp spec/dummy/config/aws.yml.example spec/dummy/config/aws.yml

NB: +aws.yml+ should be excluded from source control. This allows you to enter your AWS 
credentials safely. On the other hand, +aws.yml.example+ SHOULD be under source control. 
Don't put sensitive information in it.

You're now ready to start DynamoDB Local:

 java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb

Replace +-sharedDb+ with +-inMemory+ to run the DB in RAM.

With DynamoDB Local running, you should now be able to do

 rspec

All tests should pass.

== Rails console

The Rails console is available from the built-in dummy application:

 cd spec/dummy
 rails console

This will, amongst other things, also create the CloudModel table if it doesn't already
exist. On Amazon, this will take a little while. With DynamoDB Local, it's practically
instant.

When you leave the console, you must navigate back to the top directory (<tt>cd ../..</tt>)
in order to be able to run RSpec again.
